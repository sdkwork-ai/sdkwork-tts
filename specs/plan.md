### Critical Architecture Bug Found (Session 2)
After Steps 1-8, audio was STILL noise ("rumbling water"). Investigation found `cond_mean=0.0002` — near-zero conditioning reaching DiT.

**Root cause**: `pipeline.rs:517-532` uses `gpt.embed_mel_codes()` + `gpt_layer` projection for mel code embeddings. Python reference uses `semantic_codec.quantizer.vq2emb()` (MaskGCT codebook) — a fundamentally different embedding:

| | Python (correct) | Rust (broken) |
|---|---|---|
| Mel code embedding | `semantic_codec.quantizer.vq2emb(codes)` | `gpt.embed_mel_codes()` → `gpt_layer()` |
| Codebook | MaskGCT semantic codec [8192, 8] + proj_out [1024, 8] | GPT mel_embedding [8194, 1280] |
| Output dim | 1024 (direct from codebook + proj) | 1024 (via wrong 1280→256→128→1024 path) |
| Result | Correct acoustic embeddings | Wrong representation → near-zero S_infer → noise |

**Fix**: Downloaded MaskGCT checkpoint from `amphion/MaskGCT`. Two builder agents deployed:
1. Update `SemanticCodec` to load quantizer codebook weights (agent a3faddd)
2. Fix `pipeline.rs` to use `semantic_codec.vq2emb()` (agent a26b84b)

### Previous Key Findings
- **Conformer**: was the only component with broken weight loading
- **DiT**: was misdiagnosed (diagnostic tool had wrong keys)
- **Wav2Vec-BERT and Perceiver**: already loading correctly
- **gpt_layer has no activations**: confirmed correct per checkpoint structure (consecutive indices 0,1,2)

## Task Description

The IndexTTS2 Rust TTS system compiles and runs end-to-end (131 tests pass, CLI works, WAV files are generated), but audio output is noise/rumbling water instead of speech. The root cause is confirmed: 4 of 5 model components (Wav2Vec-BERT, DiT, Conformer, Perceiver) are running with random weights because the pre-trained checkpoint files use different tensor naming conventions than the Rust structs. Only BigVGAN vocoder weights load correctly. Additionally, the project directory is cluttered with months of debugging artifacts that need removal.

## Objective

1. Fix weight loading for all 4 broken model components so that pre-trained weights are correctly mapped from safetensors checkpoint files to the Rust model structs, producing recognizable speech audio instead of noise.
2. Clean up the project directory by removing ~25 stale files/directories and updating surviving documentation.

## Problem Statement

The Rust model structs load safetensors via `HashMap<String, Tensor>` with manual key lookups. The tensor key names in the checkpoint files do not match the key names the Rust code expects. When a key is missing, each component silently falls back to random initialization. This means the forward pass runs without errors but produces garbage output because the learned weights are never applied. Example mismatches:

- **Wav2Vec-BERT** (`wav2vec_bert.safetensors`): Checkpoint uses `encoder.layers.0.self_attn.linear_q.weight` — Rust looks up `encoder.layers.0.self_attn.linear_q.weight` (this component may actually be loading correctly based on code inspection; diagnosis step will confirm).
- **DiT** (`s2mel.safetensors`): Checkpoint uses `cfm.estimator.transformer.layers.0.attention.wqkv.weight` — Rust already uses `cfm.estimator` prefix (may be loading; diagnosis will confirm).
- **Conformer** (`gpt.safetensors`): Checkpoint uses `conditioning_encoder.encoders.{i}.*` — Rust expects same prefix (needs verification).
- **Perceiver** (`gpt.safetensors`): Checkpoint uses `perceiver_encoder.*` — Rust expects same prefix (needs verification).

The real issue may be more subtle than simple name mismatches — it could be missing tensors, wrong shapes, incorrect prefix stripping, or silent fallback to random init when any single tensor in a layer fails to load. The diagnosis phase will identify exactly which tensors are missing vs loaded.

## Solution Approach

1. **Diagnose first**: Write a diagnostic binary that loads each safetensors file, enumerates every tensor key, and compares against the exact keys the Rust code attempts to look up. Produce a per-component report showing loaded vs missing vs random-init tensors.
2. **Fix per-component**: For each broken component, implement the minimal mapping (rename, prefix adjustment, or key translation) needed to load all tensors from the checkpoint.
3. **Validate end-to-end**: Run full inference and verify the output WAV contains recognizable speech with mel statistics close to the speaker reference.
4. **Clean up**: Remove junk files, update documentation.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Cleanup
Remove ~25 junk/stale files and directories accumulated during months of debugging. Update no code — purely filesystem operations.

### Phase 2: Weight Diagnosis
Create a diagnostic Rust binary that loads each safetensors checkpoint, enumerates every tensor key with shape, and compares against what the Rust model code expects. Produce a structured report showing: (a) tensors successfully loaded, (b) tensors expected but missing, (c) tensors present in checkpoint but not consumed. This report drives all subsequent mapping work.

### Phase 3: Weight Mapping Implementation
For each of the 4 broken components, implement the minimal code changes to correctly map checkpoint tensor names to what the Rust structs expect. This may involve renaming keys before lookup, adjusting prefix handling, or adding tensor reshape/transpose operations. Each component is independent and can be fixed in parallel.

### Phase 4: Integration Validation
Run full end-to-end inference with fixed weights. Verify output WAV contains recognizable speech. Compare mel spectrogram statistics (generated mel mean should be close to speaker mel mean ~-6.5, not -10).

### Phase 5: Documentation Update
Update CLAUDE.md, CURRENT_STATUS.md, and DEBUGGING.md to reflect the weight loading fix and cleanup. Remove references to deleted files. Simplify "Next Steps" section.

## Team Orchestration

- You operate as the team lead and orchestrate the team to execute the plan.
- You're responsible for deploying the right team members with the right context to execute the plan.
- IMPORTANT: You NEVER operate directly on the codebase. You use `Task` and `Task*` tools to deploy team members to to the building, validating, testing, deploying, and other tasks.
  - This is critical. You're job is to act as a high level director of the team, not a builder.
  - You're role is to validate all work is going well and make sure the team is on track to complete the plan.
  - You'll orchestrate this by using the Task* Tools to manage coordination between the team members.
  - Communication is paramount. You'll use the Task* Tools to communicate with the team members and ensure they're on track to complete the plan.
- Take note of the session id of each team member. This is how you'll reference them.

### 3. Diagnose Weight Loading for All 4 Components
- **Task ID**: diagnose-weights
- **Depends On**: none
- **Assigned To**: builder-diagnosis
- **Agent Type**: general-purpose
- **Parallel**: true (can run alongside cleanup)
- Read `<reference-checkout>\CLAUDE.md` FIRST to understand the full architecture and module map.
- Read the skill documentation at `<home> Smith\.claude-membership\skills\rust-tts\SKILL.md` to understand Candle patterns and weight loading.
- Use the `Context7` MCP tool: run `Context7:resolve-library-id "candle machine learning"` then `Context7:get-library-docs` with topic `"safetensors VarBuilder load"` to fetch up-to-date Candle documentation on safetensors loading.
- Create a new Rust binary at `<reference-checkout>\src\bin\diagnose_weights.rs` that does the following for each checkpoint file:
  1. Load the safetensors file using `candle_core::safetensors::load()` to get a `HashMap<String, Tensor>`.
  2. Print every tensor key and its shape, sorted alphabetically.
  3. For each model component, list which keys the Rust code attempts to look up (trace through the `from_tensors` / `load_weights` functions in the source files).
  4. Categorize each expected key as: FOUND (present in checkpoint), MISSING (not in checkpoint → falls back to random), or SHAPE_MISMATCH.
  5. Print a summary per component: total expected tensors, found, missing, shape mismatches.
- The checkpoint files to diagnose:
  - `<reference-checkout>\checkpoints\wav2vec_bert.safetensors` — expected keys come from `src/models/semantic/wav2vec_bert.rs` (the `EncoderLayer::from_tensors`, `FeatureProjection::from_tensors`, `SelfAttention::from_tensors`, `FeedForward::from_tensors`, `ConvModule::from_tensors` functions)
  - `<reference-checkout>\checkpoints\gpt.safetensors` — expected keys come from `src/models/gpt/conformer.rs` and `src/models/gpt/perceiver.rs` (trace through `load_weights` methods)
  - `<reference-checkout>\checkpoints\s2mel.safetensors` — expected keys come from `src/models/s2mel/dit.rs` (the `DiffusionTransformer::load_weights` method, using prefix `cfm.estimator`)
  - `<reference-checkout>\checkpoints\bigvgan.safetensors` — include as WORKING REFERENCE to show what correct loading looks like
- Also cross-reference with the Python source files at `<reference-checkout>\indextts\` to identify any tensors in the checkpoint that the Python code uses but the Rust code does not attempt to load.
- Run the diagnostic: `cd <reference-checkout> && cargo run --release --bin diagnose_weights`
- Save the full output to `<reference-checkout>\specs\weight_diagnosis_report.txt`
- CRITICAL: Do NOT modify any model source files in this task. This is diagnosis only.

### 10. Update Documentation
- **Task ID**: update-docs

- **Agent Type**: general-purpose
- **Parallel**: false
- Read current `<reference-checkout>\CLAUDE.md`, `<reference-checkout>\CURRENT_STATUS.md`, and `<reference-checkout>\DEBUGGING.md`.

  - Change status banner from "PIPELINE RUNS BUT AUDIO IS NOISE" to reflect current state (either "AUDIO WORKING" or "WEIGHT LOADING FIXED — AUDIO QUALITY UNDER EVALUATION")
  - Remove the "Model Weight Loading Status" section's misleading "✅ Loaded" markers if any were previously incorrect
  - Remove references to all deleted files (the `@fix_plan*.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `FIXES.md`, etc.)
  - Remove stale Ralph Loop commands section (or update with current commands)
  - Update the "Key Files" table to remove deleted files
  - Simplify "Next Steps" to only list remaining work (CUDA support, performance optimization, Python bindings)
  - Update the "Progress Tracker" to reflect weight loading completion
- Update `CURRENT_STATUS.md` with the resolution of the weight loading issue
- Update `DEBUGGING.md`:
  - Add a section documenting the weight name mismatch root cause and fix
  - Merge any key information from the now-deleted `FIXES.md` into this file
  - Document which tensors were missing per component and how they were mapped
- Merge key fix information from `FIXES.md` (which was deleted in cleanup) into `DEBUGGING.md` before the deletion takes effect. If `FIXES.md` was already deleted, use your knowledge of the prior fix history from `CLAUDE.md` and `DEBUGGING.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Weight loading**: All 4 broken components (Wav2Vec-BERT, DiT, Conformer, Perceiver) load 100% of their tensors from the checkpoint files with zero fallback to random initialization (excepting truly optional/unused tensors with documented justification).
2. **Audio quality**: Running `cargo run --release --bin indextts2 -- --cpu infer --text "Hello world" --speaker "speaker_16k.wav" --output "output.wav"` produces a WAV file containing recognizable speech (not noise/rumbling).
3. **Mel statistics**: Generated mel spectrogram mean is within 2 dB of the speaker reference mel mean (~-6.5).
4. **Tests pass**: `cargo test` passes all existing tests (131+) with no regressions.
5. **Compilation**: `cargo build --release` completes without errors or new warnings related to weight loading.
6. **Cleanup**: All files listed in the deletion list are removed. All files listed in the keep list remain. Project root contains only expected files.
7. **Documentation**: `CLAUDE.md`, `CURRENT_STATUS.md`, and `DEBUGGING.md` accurately reflect the current project state with no references to deleted files.

- `dir <reference-checkout>\*.md` — Verify only CLAUDE.md, CURRENT_STATUS.md, DEBUGGING.md, README.md remain as markdown files in root
- `dir <reference-checkout>\*.wav` — Verify only speaker.wav, speaker_16k.wav, and output_fixed.wav remain

## Notes

- **DO NOT rewrite model architecture**: The Rust implementations are correct. Only the weight *loading* (key name mapping) is broken.
- **DO NOT touch BigVGAN**: It already works correctly. Use it as a reference for how correct loading should look.
- **DO NOT change inference pipeline logic**: The three fixes already applied (FinalLayer AdaLN, GroupNorm, prompt_x) are correct.
- **DO NOT add new dependencies**: Use only existing crates (`candle-core`, `candle-nn`, `safetensors`, etc.).
- **Candle framework**: This project uses HuggingFace Candle (Rust ML framework), NOT PyTorch or ONNX. Model weights are in safetensors format loaded via `candle_core::safetensors::load()` into `HashMap<String, Tensor>`.
- **Silent fallback is the enemy**: The current code silently falls back to random init when a tensor key is missing. After fixing, consider making missing expected tensors produce loud warnings or errors instead of silent random fallback.
- If the diagnosis reveals that some components ARE loading correctly (the CLAUDE.md claims "all loaded" but audio is still noise), the issue may be in tensor shape/dtype handling, or in how the loaded tensors are applied during the forward pass. The diagnosis step will clarify this.
